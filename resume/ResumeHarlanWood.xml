    <text>
      Drawing from my own entrepreneurial experience, 
      I am strongly focused on customer collaboration and delivery of concrete business value. 

      I have great respect for the lean/agile toolkit, and I have driven the adoption of 
      automated testing, 
      continuous integration, 
      code quality visualizations, 
      executable plain text specifications,
      and formal process improvement.  

      I balance my technical interests with creative pursuits.

      I am an inspired human, and I bring this inspiration to my work and my life.

        Harlan is a very competent project manager. He is detail oriented and doesn't let anything fall through the cracks. He is proactive in getting his people together to have those tough conversations. Harlan is very much an advocate of transparency and is able to report the appropriate level of information to the right people, so they in turn can stay on the pulse of the project. Harlan has been fantastic to work with and I would be honored to work with him on a project again.

    <testimonialUnedited>I worked with Harlan for about 18 months at Wireless Generation. During that time Harlan was a progressive force in the company, promoting agile practices and helping us improve the way we made software. Harlan quickly saw the need for and developed an automated build process. In retrospect I don't know how we got by without an automated build, but at the time there was some skepticism. He set up code metric and other tools. He promoted unit tests and a concern for developing high quality software in a modern sense. And of course he producing high quality applications. More than anything, Harlan brings a passion for developing software the right way.</testimonialUnedited>
