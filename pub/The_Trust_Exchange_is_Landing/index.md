When I came back to the US in 2006 after studying for several years with a meditation school in Australia, I found myself the happy recipient of large-scale "downloads" of systems for global transformation through development of certain technologies -- notably creative collaboration, trust and ratings exchanges, and information visualization systems.

I developed these ideas with my friends [Adam Apollo][] and [Jack Senechal][] over the course of several years, in numerous working sessions and impassioned conversations.  The project that we saw as the capstone of this interlinked layer of "[enlightened structure][]" we called the [Trust Exchange][].  An excerpt from our writings on the topic:

> The Trust Exchange will amalgamate existing ratings from any source, feeding them into a free, open, globally distributed database.  Instead of creating another proprietary "silo" containing your ratings and trust information, like so many existing online systems, the Trust Exchange is a simple and powerful open platform for humanity to exchange its trust information. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, when my luminous change agent friend [Shiloh Boss][] send me a link to an article by Venessa Miemis -- who organized the delicious-looking Contact Summit last Thursday in NYC -- called [10 Projects to Liberate the Web][].  The one that swept me off my feet was #13 (yes, out of 10) -- [Connect.me][].

Connect.me serves up an easy to use -- even slightly addictive -- platform for "vouching" for people you know in various areas.  For example, I vouched for my entrepreneur friend Tristan Kromer in the field of "lean startup", and the EFF's John Perry Barlow as a "thought leader".

The folks at Connect.me have developed an excellent Trust Framework -- in particular, I highly recommend their deeply thoughtful whitepaper [The Personal Network][].  As a small sample, here are their "Trust Framework Assurances":

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Control: Only you decide who your personal data is shared with for what purpose
  </p>  
  <p>  
    Peace of Mind: Your data will not being used without your permission
  </p>  
  <p>  
    Freedom: You can always take your data with you and never be “locked in”
  </p>  
</blockquote>

Let's build the trust network on Connect.me together -- these people have their values in absolutely the right place, including the important promise of data portability to other networks.
